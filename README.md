# Traffic_System
The traffic light system we have designed consists of four roads, where the north and 
south roads work together, and the east and west roads work in coordination. The system 
is primarily aimed at ensuring the safety of pedestrians and cars/vehicles.
The traffic light system has an additional feature, the pedestrian button. It allows people 
to reduce the waiting time for crossing the street. Pressing the button automatically 
decreases the green light time for the vehicle traffic. This feature provides an added level 
of safety to pedestrians, ensuring they can cross the road safely and efficiently.
Our system has been designed with crowd sensor to avoid traffic jams and make it more 
efficient for cars. We have ensured that the lights are well-lit, and the timing is 
synchronized to provide maximum safety to all users.
Overall, our traffic light system provides a safe and efficient means of managing traffic 
flow while ensuring the safety of all road users, especially pedestrians. Our system is 
designed to prevent accidents and reduce traffic congestion, making it an excellent choice 
for managing traffic in busy urban areas.
